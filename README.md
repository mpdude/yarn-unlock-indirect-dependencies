# Unlock ðŸ”“ indirect `yarn` dependencies ðŸ§¶

### Motivation

According to the feature request in [yarnpkg/yarn#4986](https://github.com/yarnpkg/yarn#4986) (opened 11/2017), `yarn` seems to install (of course) "indirect" or "transitive" dependencies for packages it installs, and it also writes these dependencies to the `yarn.lock` file. 

However, a later `yarn upgrade` will only check _direct_ dependencies. Only when a _direct_ dependency is upgraded to another version, its transitive dependencies are evaluated and upgraded as well.

This means, for example, that
* when you install a package A that has a dependency on some other package B,
* and B fixes a security issue and creates a new version for the fix,
* `yarn upgrade` is _not_ going to update B for you 
* _until_ A releases a newer version and you upgrade to it.

### The Workaround

The script in this repository tries to work around this situation.

It will **remove all packages from the `yarn.lock` file** that are **not specified as direct dependencies**, i. e. in `dependencies`, `devDependencies`, `peerDependencies` or `optionalDependencies` of your `package.json` file.

The idea is that for packages that you don't specify as your own (direct) dependencies, you generally don't care what version gets installed. So, it should not make a difference for your own code to upgrade those dependencies in the background. Of course, there is a risk things breaking inside your dependencies. In a perfect world, where everyone specified and tagged their versions correctly, however, this should rarely happen.

### Usage

In the directory containing your `yarn.lock` file, run 

```bash
node ../path/to/unlock-indirect-yarn-dependencies/dist/index.js
(... prints unlocked packages ...)
yarn install
```

The first step will remove indirect dependencies from the `yarn.lock` file, and the subsequent `yarn install` will take care of resolving and updating the indirect dependencies again.

Don't forget to commit the updated `yarn.lock` file to version control.
